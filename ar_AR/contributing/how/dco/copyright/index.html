    <p>Copyright is the right, created in law, granting a creator of an original work the exclusive rights to decide how that work is used and distributed.</p>
<p>Copyright is granted, immediately and by default, to the person that creates a piece of work, when they create it. If you write a song, write a book, or write some software - you are the creator of that work. And you have the right to decide how that creation will be used.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-copyright">
<h2>What is a copyright?</h2>
<p>A copyright - using the word as a noun - is property. It's intellectual property. It's something that can be bought and sold. It can only be owned by a single legal entity at any given time. If I have a copyright, and I sell it to you, you now own it. <em>You</em> have the copyright for the work.</p>
<p>Copyright is not granted indefinitely. It's granted for a period of time. In theory, it eventually expires, and when it does, the work reverts to the public domain. I say in theory, because copyright durations keep being extended - but in theory, all work will eventually revert to the public domain.</p>
<p>If you've got a tangible, physical piece of property, there are obvious limitations on use. This is <em>my</em> phone. And if you take it without my permission, you're stealing it, and that's a criminal act. But I can give you permission - I can give you license to use my phone - and then it isn't a criminal act for you to use my phone.</p>
<p>Giving you license to use my phone usually won't be accompanied by legal paperwork. Usually. But it could be. If I was particularly worried about, say, you tweeting &quot;pooping&quot; while you had access to my phone, I could get you to sign a legally binding agreement that says you won't do that.</p>
<p>If I do decide to license my phone to you - that doesn't inherently give you property rights over the phone. You don't get the right to lend the phone to someone else -- unless the license grants you that right. It's still <em>my</em> property; you're just <em>using it under license</em>.</p>
<p>However, I can <em>give</em> or <em>sell</em> you my phone - I can transfer my property right to you. But it makes a big legal difference whether I'm <em>giving</em> you my phone, or <em>licensing</em> you my phone.</p>
<p>Hopefully, it's clear that the terms &quot;copyright&quot; and &quot;license&quot; aren't interchangable - they're complementary pieces of the same puzzle.</p>
<p>A piece of software is intellectual property. The copyright for a piece of software is owned by someone - by default, the creator. If you want to use a piece of software, you have to be either given ownership - given the copyright - or granted a license to use the work. And it makes a big difference which one you get.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="copyleft">
<h2>Copyleft</h2>
<p>Traditionally, copyright was granted to give a creator exclusivity to sell copies of their work. The expectation was that people would license copies of their work in exchange for payment.</p>
<p>But in the early 80s, the Free Software Foundation engineered a very clever legal hack. They wrote a software license that, rather than defending the rights of the creator, they defended the rights of the recipient.</p>
<p>The result was copyleft. Copyleft is <em>not</em> a replacement for copyright. It's a very clever legal hack that <em>uses</em> copyright law to enforce the exact opposite to what copyright was intended to provide. Without copyright law, copyleft couldn't exist.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-is-a-license-required">
<h2>Why is a license required?</h2>
<p>If you <em>don't</em> provide a license, the default licensing terms on your creation are &quot;ALL RIGHTS RESERVED&quot; - even if you don't say that. This means nobody can legally use your code. And if you see code with no clearly offered license, you cannot legally use it.</p>
<p>This applies to any creation, no matter how big or small - every patch you submit to a project for inclusion is a creative work; and that means a license is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="public-domain">
<h2>Public Domain</h2>
<p>This probably sounds like a whole lot more trouble than it's worth. Why can't you just say &quot;Well, I'm giving this away to the public domain&quot;.</p>
<p>As the creator of a work, in some jurisdictions, certain rights <em>cannot</em> be transferred.</p>
<p>Issues of copyright are closely associated with a concept known as Moral Rights - rights that are considered innate to the human experience. The problem is that the area of Moral rights is <em>very</em> jurisdiction dependent. Moral rights recognized by European - and, in particular, German courts - are <em>much</em> stronger than the moral rights recognized by US courts.</p>
<p>So - a declaration that you've released your code into the public domain is actually <em>illegal</em> in Germany. German courts won't recognize that transfer of ownership - any more than they'd recognize a legal agreement to sell yourself into slavery. Your moral right to fair compensation for your creative effort is a moral right that is considered unalienable. And so, your work reverts to it's default license: All rights reserved. So Germans then can't use your code.</p>

<div class="section" id="developer-certificates-of-origin">
<h2>Developer Certificates of Origin</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways to manage the process of licensing contributions, but the BeeWare project uses a mechanism known as a <a class="reference external" href="/contributing/how/dco/what/">Developer Certificate of Origin</a>. For more details on what  DCO is, and what it means, <a class="reference external" href="/contributing/how/dco/what/">see our explanatory guide</a>.  If you've need help configuring your system to comply with our DCO <a class="reference external" href="/contributing/how/dco/how/">we've got some step by step instructions to help you out</a>.</p>
